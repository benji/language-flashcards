  -> backend: meta store that saves the order
    -> list = load meta only
    -> click -> load actual flashcard!

- save / backup?



Save all entries in 1 record?
  1 expr = 10-30
  1 entry = 20-60
  say 50/entry on avg

  5120/50 -> 102 entries 

  limit to 80/80 chars?

when reach MAX(5K) - 100*2 -> disallow adding new entries
