- being able to order the flashcards
    
  -> UI: how would that work on mobile?
  https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/
    - include js
    - just try to make the UI part work

  -> backend: meta store that saves the order
    -> new flashcard -> update meta order (add first)
    -> remove flashcard -> update meta order (rm)
    -> list = load meta only
    -> click -> load actual flashcard!

- save / backup?


need to cache data: flashcards + order + settings
need for a global state shared = cache
use same API for batch loading
load order first and FCs on demand
