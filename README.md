# Language Flashcards

Create custom Flashcards for any language.
https://benji.github.io/language-flashcards/

You can then "play" the flashcards as a randomized quizz with just 1 finger tap.
Espcially convenient when you are on the go. Optimized for mobile.

This app uses onestore.io to store the flashcards.
**Create a free account** and **create a namespace** for this app to store your flashcards so that they are available from anywhere.

If you want to create multiple sets of flashcards, you can create separate namespaces in onestore.io.

Have fun!
